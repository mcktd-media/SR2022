Each save file in this set is actually exported from my PS4 saves into .sf_pc format. (As a side note, if you have a PS4, you can import these .sf_pc format files back into your existing PS4 saves using Save Wizard for example.)

To use these files on a PC first remove all existing save files (except your SR_PROFILE files) from your Saints Row 2022 game save folder. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE MADE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR SAVES FIRST!!!

Select the mission save you would like to use and copy it into your Saints Row 2022 game save folder.

Launch Saints Row 2022 and select CONTINUE to load the game save. Once the game starts, press esc, go to the save menu and SAVE NEW GAME. The game will be saved with a different file name along with it's associated .met_pc file. You can then keep these two files and delete the original mission save from your game save folder. 

Enjoy...
